People use virtual reality to iterate space and time, create a virtual universe much larger than the real world, and gradually transfer human consciousness to the virtual universe.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the virtual world requires supercomputing power. For this reason, human beings circle the sun and create a supercomputer, the CentreBrain, hoping to use its powerful computing power to expand the virtual home. The computing power of the CentreBrain gradually reaches its limit because the number of consciousness continues to grow. If want to accommodate more consciousness, it needs more energy supply. So, the COSMO launched an engineering project code-named Dyson Sphere Program, sending engineers to the real world to build the Dyson sphere to provide continuous and stable energy for the CentreBrain. As a member of COSMO and the pioneer of the Dyson Sphere Program, you will control the mecha on an unknown journey by using the terminal. You need gather resources, plan and design production lines, gradually realize full automation, starting from scratch. And transform your factory from a small workshop, developing into a magnificent inter-galactic industrial empire, and finally built a great miracle, the Dyson Sphere.\r\n\r\nBuilders of great civilizations!
